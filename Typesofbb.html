<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:Center; font-size:30px; color:black">Old Testament</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:justify; font-size:16px; color:White ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Old Testament is the first of the two major sections of the Christian Bible. The Old Testament contains the sacred writings of the Jews. It was written over the period of roughly 1000 B.C. to 100 B.C., but it includes narration of events that occurred many centuries earlier and had been passed from generation to generation in oral form. The Old Testament was originally written in the Hebrew language with a few sections written in the Aramaic language.</p>



<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:left; font-size:16px; color:black">1. The Bible is incomplete without the Old Testament.</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:justify; font-size:16px; color:White ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both the Old and New Testaments make up the Word of God. The New Testament was never given to replace the Old Testament but rather to complete its story. Genesis 3:14-19 records how a curse came upon humanity because of sin. Revelation 22:3 completes the story by recording how God, through the redemptive work of Jesus, has removed the curse. The theme of God’s redemptive work would be incomplete without both Testaments revealing the beginning and end of the curse.</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:left; font-size:16px; color:black">2. The Old Testament presents great truths about God and humanity.</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:justify; font-size:16px; color:White ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first five books of the Bible (the Torah), God reaches out to humanity and introduces Himself. God introduces Himself as the Creator (Gen. 1-2), the Savior of His people (Exod. 13-14), the Holy One (Lev. 19:2), the God of wrath and judgment on sin (Num. 14), and a God of love (Deut. 7). It is in the Hebrew Bible that God reveals to Moses His attributes (Exod. 34:6-7). We would not know God as well as we do apart from the revelation of the Old Testament.</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:left; font-size:16px; color:black">3. The Old Testament provides the historical setting out of which Christianity and the New Testament emerged.</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:justify; font-size:16px; color:White ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Christianity didn’t emerge from a vacuum. God was moving among the people of Israel to bring forth the Messiah who would provide redemption from the judgment that came on humanity because of sin. The early New Testament preachers like Stephen (Acts 7) and Paul (Acts 13:16-41) made frequent use of the Hebrew Bible to declare God’s plan for salvation. The story line of God’s work in salvation begins in the Hebrew Bible and then continues its flow through the New Testament.</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:left; font-size:16px; color:black">4. The Old Testament instructs believers concerning the person and work of Jesus, the promised Messiah.</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:justify; font-size:16px; color:White ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His birth, His death, His resurrection, His return and His kingdom are all revealed in the Hebrew Bible (Luke 24:44-46). If you want to get to know Jesus, the Lamb of God, you cannot neglect the prophecies found in the Old Testament.</p>


<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:left; font-size:16px; color:black">5. The Old Testament presents spiritual truths and lessons that are applicable for Christians.</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:justify; font-size:16px; color:White ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paul illustrates this in 1 Corinthians 10:6-10, where he recounts for the church at Corinth a number of incidents that took place during Israel’s wilderness wanderings. Then he writes, “Now these things happened to them as an example, and they were written for our instruction, upon whom the ends of the ages have come.” Paul clearly intended for the Corinthians to learn from the lessons taught in the Hebrew Bible (see also Rom. 15:4).</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:Center; font-size:30px; color:black">New Testament</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:justify; font-size:16px; color:White ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The New Testament is a record of the life, teachings, and mission of Jesus Christ and the ministry of His disciples in promoting the spread of the early Christian Church. The word that was translated as testament could also be translated as covenant; thus the New Testament is the new covenant.</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:justify; font-size:16px; color:White ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christians see in the New Testament the fulfillment of the promise of the Old Testament. It relates and interprets the new covenant, represented in the life and death of Jesus, between God and the followers of Christ, the promised Messiah. Like the Old Testament, it contains a variety of kinds of writing. Among its 27 books are selected recollections of the life and acts and sayings of Jesus in the four Gospels;</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:justify; font-size:16px; color:White ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The New Testament contains twenty-seven books that can be grouped into four main categories based on the nature of their content.

</p>


<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:left; font-size:16px; color:black">1. Historical Books</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:justify; font-size:15px; color:White ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This group consists of the four Gospels and the book of Acts. The Gospels record the testimonies of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John concerning the ministry of the Savior. The book of Acts is an account of the ministry of several of the Lord’s Apostles.</p>


<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:left; font-size:16px; color:black">2. Epistles of Paul</p>


<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:justify; font-size:15px; color:White ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This group consists of the books of Romans through Hebrews. The word epistle means “letter.” Most of Paul’s letters were written to specific branches of the Church organized in cities where Paul had proclaimed the gospel and which he had established.</p>


<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:left; font-size:16px; color:black">3. General Epistles</p>


<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:justify; font-size:15px; color:White ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his group consists of letters written by James, Peter, John, and Jude. They are called General Epistles because they are not addressed to specific branches of the Church or individuals, except for John’s second and third letters.</p>


<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:left; font-size:16px; color:black">4. The Apocalypse</p>


<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:justify; font-size:15px; color:White ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the last book in the New Testament and is known as the book of Revelation. It is a record of a vision received by the Apostle John while imprisoned on the Isle of Patmos. John saw the history of the earth, including the events of the last days and the eventual victory of Jesus Christ over the kingdom of Satan.</p>
