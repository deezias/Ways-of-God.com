<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:justify; font-size:15px; color:White ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God has spoken in many ways about who
he is through others. but ultimately he speaks to us through his son, Jesus Christ. Finally in Jesus, God says everything he desires to say about who he is
and who he desires us to be sons and daughters in the holy spirit. God sent forth the apostles he had chosen commissioning them to the gospel and they
did this through preaching and writing.</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:justify; font-size:15px; color:White ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is where we acquired the bible but not just that.
What Jesus handed on to his apostles is what we call the deposit of faith. Which is everything that God chose to reveal about who he is, his real presence
in the world, and what he has done.</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:justify; font-size:15px; color:White ">God speaks in two ways we can understand.</p>



<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:Center; font-size:20px; color:grey">Sacred Tradition</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:justify; font-size:15px; color:White ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sacred Tradition is the living transmission of all that came from God and was passed down to his apostles. Then apostles left bishops
as their successors to hand what God gave them.</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:Center; font-size:20px; color:grey">Sacred scriptures</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:justify; font-size:15px; color:White ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A perfect example would be the bible, which is the speech of God that was put into writing.
Tradition and scripture are the two different ways God has communicated everything he releaved to his apostles and their successors all the way to us 2000 years later.</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:Center; font-size:20px; color:grey">Holy spirit</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:justify; font-size:15px; color:White ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God gave the church, his ongoing presence in the holy spirit so that he could guide the apostles and their successors to teach what he gave them faithfully.</p>
