<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:Center; font-size:30px; color:black">God Revealing Himself to humans</p>




<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:left; font-size:16px; color:black">1. Adam And Eve</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:justify; font-size:16px; color:White ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Adam and Eve first sinned in the Garden of Eden God immediately spoke to them.

They heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden. Then the Lord God called to the man, and said to him, "Where are you?" (Genesis 3:8,9).</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:left; font-size:16px; color:black">2. Noah</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:justify; font-size:16px; color:White ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God revealed Himself to Noah and told him of the impending Flood.

So God said to Noah, "I am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them. I am surely going to destroy both them and the earth"</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:left; font-size:16px; color:black">3. Abraham</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:justify; font-size:16px; color:White ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God revealed Himself to Abraham on a number of occasions. God initially called him out of his own country.

The LORD had said to Abram, "Leave your country, your people and your father's household and go to the land I will show you. I will make you into a great nation and I will bless you; I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse; and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you"</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:left; font-size:16px; color:black">4. Isaac</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:justify; font-size:16px; color:White ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isaac, the son of Abraham, received personal revelation from God.

That night the LORD appeared to him [Isaac] and said, "I am the God of your father Abraham. Do not be afraid, for I am with you; I will bless you and will increase the number of your descendants for the sake of my servant Abraham" (Genesis 26:24).</p>


<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:left; font-size:16px; color:black">5. Jacob</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:justify; font-size:16px; color:White ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jacob had personal visits from God on a number of occasions.

There beside him stood the LORD and said: "I am the LORD, the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac. I will give you and your descendants the land on which you are lying" (Genesis 28:13).</p>
