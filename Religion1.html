<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:justify; font-size:14px; color:White ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God has revealed Himself to us with the most clarity and detail in the person of Jesus Christ. He is the living, 
breathing, flesh-and-blood, human presentation of God: “The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth” (John 1:14).</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:justify; font-size:14px; color:White ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of Jesus, John writes in his gospel: “No one has ever seen God. But the unique One, who is himself God, is near to the Father’s heart. 
He has revealed God to us” (John 1:18,). Paul told the Colossians, “Christ is the visible image of the invisible God. He existed before anything was created and is supreme over all creation” (Colossians 1:15,). 
And Jesus said to Philip, “Have I been with you all this time, Philip, and yet you still don’t know who I am? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father!” (John 14:9,).</p>



<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:Center; font-size:20px; color:grey">Jesus Christ</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:justify; font-size:14px; color:White ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The name Jesus is derived from the Hebrew-Aramaic word Yeshua, meaning “Yahweh [the Lord] is salvation.” 
The name Christ is actually a title for Jesus. It comes from the Greek word “Christos,” meaning “the Anointed One,” or “Messiah” in Hebrew.</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:justify; font-size:14px; color:White ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Jesus Christ was crucified in Jerusalem by order of Pontius Pilate, 
the Roman governor, for claiming to be the King of the Jews. He resurrected three days after his death, appeared to his disciples, and then ascended into heaven.</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:justify; font-size:14px; color:White ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His life and death provided the atoning sacrifice for the sins of the world. The Bible teaches 
that humankind was separated from God through Adam's sin but was reconciled back to God through Jesus Christ's sacrifice.</p>
 
<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:justify; font-size:14px; color:White ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In John the Baptist own words when Jesus approached him. John called out, "Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!" 
He also explained, "This is the Son of God."</p>
