<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:justify; font-size:14px; color:White ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God’s makes himself known as Lord through divine revelation, which is given to all people through creation and human nature and to specific people through events, inspired human words recorded as Scripture, and Jesus Christ himself.</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:justify; font-size:14px; color:White ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God makes himself known to his creatures because he first knows himself perfectly as a personal, speaking God. Although all people suppress the knowledge of God in their sin, he has clearly communicated about himself to his creatures through the creation and through human’s being made in the image of God.</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:justify; font-size:14px; color:White ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When People think of Divine Revelation they imediately think of Jesus Christ. Although Jesus Christ was the most notable
Revelation of God Himself, In the Old Testament God also revealed himself through the passage of specific people. when clicking the upper title it will take you to all the information
about God revealing himself to Humans.</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:justify; font-size:14px; color:White ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ultimate purpose of all revelation from God is so that human beings can have a personal relationship with their Creator. The Bible speaks of a God who not only exists He is also personally involved in the lives of His people.</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:justify; font-size:14px; color:White ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bible was written in two parts, the Old Testament (39 books) and the New Testament (27 books) </p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:Center; font-size:20px; color:black">Old Testament</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:justify; font-size:14px; color:White ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Old Testament described the history of the people that God chose to be the ones through whom the Messiah would come.  Therefore, it contains the history of God’s people (the Jews) and also includes prophecies of the coming of Jesus the Messiah.  Therefore, it was divided into two time periods. One is before Christ and the other is after Christ is born. </p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:Center; font-size:20px; color:black">New Testament</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:justify; font-size:14px; color:White ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The New Testament was written as a demonstration of the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies of Jesus as well as letters written to various churches and individuals informing them of proper Christian behavior.</p>
