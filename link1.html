<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:justify; font-size:16px; color:White ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also learn of him through history, the particular 
events that shape the fortunes of human beings. He is the one who gave to all the nations their boundaries (Acts 17:26) and brought Israel out of slavery in Egypt to possess 
the land of promise. In his plan, general history becomes redemptive history, the events by which God arranges to redeem his people from sin by the coming of Jesus.</p>


<p style="font-family:Arial; text-align:justify; font-size:16px; color:White ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bible presents us with eyewitness
 testimony of the revelation of God in Jesus Christ: “For we did not follow cleverly devised stories when we told you about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in power,
 but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. . . . We ourselves heard this voice that came from heaven when we were with him on the sacred mountain. We also have the prophetic 
message as something completely reliable, and you will do well to pay attention to it, as to a light shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises 
in your hearts” (2 Peter 1:16–19).
